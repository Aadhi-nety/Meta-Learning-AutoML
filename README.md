# Meta-Learning-AutoML
This project builds a Meta-Learning framework using H2O.ai to automate model selection, enabling quick adaptation to new tasks with minimal data.

# Meta-Learning for Autonomous Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores Meta-Learning, focusing on building systems that can learn how to learn.

## Objectives
- Implement AutoML to select the best models and hyperparameters.
- Explore few-shot learning and multi-modal learning.
- Enhance self-improvement techniques for models.
- Ensure scalability for distributed datasets.
